# free-code

Free code for everyone to use for free

This code base is a collection of simple utilities, which can act as a sort of foundation or framework for JavaScript code.

The ideas that all the code is super readable and the tests live next to the code so that when you ship it users on the front end are able to actually use the code as not just a source for the browser, but also as a source for learning.

This philosophy is in contrast to the sort of bundling and minimizing that has been life in modern JavaScript.

Please use this code as a starting point and expand on it and learn from it. I'm not interested in accepting pull requests instead. I'd love for you to make something from this of your own!

You'll find all the code is sort of self-documenting ðŸ˜Ž

Please share and modify all you want, take credit for it even, this author does not care at all!
