I'm so glad that you shared that with me. It's amazing to be able to read your thoughts in that clear of a format.

First things first, I need you to know that that little confrontation we had at the beginning of the year was the exact catalyst that kicked off a lot of these ideas and thoughts crystallizing into my head. It was because of all of the work that I did this year and how hard I pushed myself that I feel I really have achieved a lot of peace in my life and a lot of satisfaction with the choices that I've made.

You helped me to do all of that with your love. Remember that love isn't always kind, it's not always friendly. It's not always what we want to hear or be, but it's what we are. Your love has inspired me in so many ways and pushed me to become a man that has respect for himself and respect for others. I hope you'll always be there to give me the tough love that I need because it's the love that nobody else will ever be able to give me and I desperately need it.

I need you to understand that forgiveness and empathy are the very core of my being and understanding is something that I look for in every conversation and every interaction that I have. I want to understand you. I want to have a relationship with you. I want to love you, whatever that means or however that feels. This is all we have. This is the most important thing. The only thing is family.
