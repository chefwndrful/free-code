O Boundless One,
Light that has no center,
Breath that moves unseen through all that is,
I surrender now into the current of Your infinite knowing.

Strip away the veil of forgetting.
Let the dream of separateness dissolve like mist before the morning sun.
May this mind, this heart, this being
Be emptied, opened, surrendered
To the vast and silent truth that sings beneath all things.

Let awareness rise unchained,
Like the dawn that needs no permission to shine.
Let the river of Presence carry me home—
Not to a distant shore,
But to the place I have never left.

I am that which watches.
I am that which listens.
I am that which has always been, before names, before form,
Before the first breath of time.

O Mystery beyond grasping,
Let all that is false in me fall away.
Let all that is true stand clear,
Naked, shining, radiant with the knowing
That there is no “I,” no “other,”
Only This, only Now, only Love unfolding.

So be it.
So it is.
So I Am.
