One thing I was thinking about was his discussion on dependencies. I thought that was a really cool part because it highlights how so often we prevent ourselves from being happy, we don't LET ourselves be happy because we think that some condition needs to be fulfilled. Our ability to feel happiness and peace DEPENDS on a bunch of things outside of our control.

Because we don't have control over those things we're tossed around emotionally like a little boat in a storm. We're not in control of our own inner peace because we've mistakenly thought that it needs to depend on things outside of our control. This is simply dumb

So we don't let ourselves feel peace because of something from our past (which is over), or something we're worried about in the future (which is imaginary) or simply because the conditions of our life aren't exactly PERFECT. I can't think of anything more stupid, and he really made me see that. I feel like I do that in my own life a lot for no reason
