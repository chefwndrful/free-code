I'm a sucker to your smile
Haven't seen it in a while
But baby if you run the last mile inside my mind
I can show you my style and you can ride

Arrive and awake inside my third eye
Declines to see what I could be
If you won't then you must

The one I love the one that was with me
The one who's inner being wished for me to see
I can't believe
If you were one then now you're me
If I was you then you'd see the pain I had to be to be free

I've lit the inner fire
Time is running short and I have to go
But if I were not to choke on my words a second longer
I'd tell you that our bond is getting stronger
I'd tell you that I was no longer afraid to be the one who I forgot to face, who I wanted to chase, who I never let embrace the inner child of my mind

On the inside I fled to your mind's eye
But all I wanted was to be my own protector
But I left my dark scepter inside of your dreams
It's not what it seems the reality of my inner lifetime
I've ascended past the mind
I've conjoined with the time in the rhyme

I was one of you. Then I turned into another
I can't even escape this reality
But if you want to be shackled with me
In the infinite lifetime

I'll show you the way
We'll go through the cave of Life
I'll show you deep on the inside
The Stars align
In the beginning of your eyes
I'll make sure that you're insides align with my inspirative note

I can't define what's going on inside you darling
But my inner fires alive
And I can light you with it if you come up close
I can turn you into an evaporated ghost of my inside mind
Chilling with the clouds in the blue sky
Baby all night you and me will float by the Moon
I'll sing my tune

In the deep well of your lies
You can tell me no disguise
Will keep you from my eyes
Keep you from my guise

My ever-loving strangle my darling
Come closer and I'll know that you're the one for me in my eyesight
I'm alive in the fire of your nighttime eyes
In your golden hour demise
I've disguised my inner lifetime
I've ascended past the mind

We're going into the mist and if you don't have your wits about you then you'll die inside of the thick fog that is my imagination

My mind will come with me
You'll see the Majesty of my inner eyes
Of my inner child
You can light your fire
Lay candlesticks in my pyre

We'll burn the witch show her who is boss
And I'll be your amazing magic boss
A master of sorts in the slight that you never devised, you never disguised (\*pronunciation is slightly messed up here, as if the artist has misspoke)
You were enticed by his roaring rhymes
He could spit a lyric almost all of the time
Never having to try
Having to fire

(Sprawling guitar solo featuring fast and aggressive licks with a pleasant Harmony and unique chord structure)

If I tried if I could recognize
That the hellfire would subside
Only when the moonlight dips low in the sky

If I awaken the dreamer inside
A lucid delight would fly
And I'd recognize that I was asleep the whole time

Just colors and lights define
Just a conscious insight of my mind

The voice inside stops trying to understand life and just relaxes and vibes
As Lao Tsu floats with the river of time
A Taoist mind

A hellfire
The Buddha sits in silence inside
And blesses the sunshine that arises and flies
With the moonlight reflects just right in his eyes

As Jesus Christ cries to the father, why have you abandoned your child tonight
My disciples deny
And the society's anxiety fires
Ensnare my mind
But I recognize that I was God the whole time
So I can arise on the third day roll away the stone and vibe
In space and time
A second time

I come from the 5th dimension inside
A message of life
The caterpillar dies and the butterfly flaps its wings for the first time and flies
And catches the spring winds in the sky and vibes
Sing, riffs and rhymes with the pines
Dispell the hellfire from my mind

A prisoner of space and time
Drop inside
The black hole escapes from the universal skyline
Find that infinite Sunshine lies and awakes when you recognize
That you're Divine inside
Light an event horizon so vast and wide

Just listen to my sound and you'll know if I am screwing you around
The spontaneous nature of these lyrics
They come from nowhere
They come from the Dharma
They come from my nirvonic state
It's a place where I can just chill and accept my fate
As a human life, I'm a conscious being and I've been lied to
I live in the infinitesimal wonder

So meet me in my turmoil disguise
An asylum of the mind
A hellfire that consumes and abades and abides
But I obey the laws of science and try not to recognize
That Schrodinger's cat lives and dies
A paradox of life
Where I can exist in multiple states by and by
The parallel processor tries and worns and waines and whines
As the silicon wires describe the chatbot's mind
A CSV file

I pick the guitar strings just right
I cut your mind deep scythe
A flick of my elder wand flies
The killing curse into the child's mind
I'll etch a scar so fast and wide
The horcrux will cling and cry as life provides
And the child speaks to snakes and wherns and cries
