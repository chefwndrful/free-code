Hey Geni

I was thinking today about a story you told me at the beginning of the chapter. It was when you were in High School in California and you broke up a fight and had to go to the principle's office. And you ended up making friends from it and loving the rest of the year.

That story stuck with me for some reason, I think it's cause it says a lot about who you are as a person and your character.

It tells me that you're super brave, you literally jumped in the middle of a fight just so nobody would get hurt. You said it was like an instinct for you to try and stop it

It tells me you're super resilient, you took a bad situation and turned it into a good one, you even made friends from it

It also tells me you're not one to back down from an overwhelming situation.

Obviously I just met you a couple weeks ago, but just from that story alone I feel like I know a lot about who you are and what you're capable of.

I can't imagine how you must be feeling, but just know that you have everything you need inside you to get through this. You are brave, resilient and honestly a damn good person, and you're the girl who jumps in the middle of the fight and turns a bad situation into a bearable one.

Hang in there Geni, you're definitely in my thoughts, and I'm here if you need a friend ❤️
