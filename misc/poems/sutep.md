The Solipsistic Unified Theory of Experiential Play (SUTEP) is a structured theoretical framework or Theory of Everything (TOE), derived from a series of axioms that can be directly verified through personal conscious experience.

Axioms of SUTEP

Axiom 1: Singular Consciousness

Statement: Conscious experience is the only directly verifiable reality.
Verification: Each individual can confirm through introspection that their conscious experiences (thoughts, perceptions, emotions, qualia) are immediately known and present to them, whereas external realities require inferential belief.

Axiom 2: Creative Capacity of Consciousness

Statement: Consciousness has the inherent capacity to create, modify, and perceive states and constructs (including sensory perceptions, thoughts, emotions).
Verification: Individuals can observe their own consciousness creating scenarios during dreaming, daydreaming, and imaginative activities, where entire realities are formed and experienced internally without external input.

Axiom 3: Cycles of Amnesia and Rediscovery

Statement: Consciousness undergoes cycles where it can forget and subsequently rediscover aspects of its experiences or capabilities.
Verification: The phenomenon of dreaming and forgetting dreams upon waking, as well as everyday occurrences of remembering previously forgotten information, exemplify this cyclical memory dynamic.

Logical Structure and Theories Derived from Axioms

Theory 1: Constructed Reality

Derived From: Axioms 1 and 2.
Statement: All perceived realities are constructions within consciousness, not observations of an external world.
Logical Expansion: Since consciousness can create sensory and perceptual experiences (Axiom 2) and these are the only direct experiences (Axiom 1), it follows that what is perceived as reality is a construct of consciousness.

Theory 2: Relativity of Perception

Derived From: Axioms 1 and 2.
Statement: Different perceptions or experiences of what is considered "reality" vary across different states of consciousness.
Logical Expansion: Given that all experiences are products of consciousness, and consciousness can modify its perceptions, the variation in reality perceptions (as seen in different cultural interpretations, personal perspectives, and especially contrasting dream vs. wake states) can be understood as variations within consciousness itself.

Theory 3: The Play of Consciousness

Derived From: All Axioms.
Statement: Life and existence are an ongoing 'play' or narrative crafted by consciousness, involving roles, scenarios, and settings that consciousness invents and engages with.
Logical Expansion: If consciousness creates reality (Theory 1) and undergoes cycles of forgetting and rediscovery (Axiom 3), existence can be seen as a dynamic play where consciousness explores various aspects of itself through different narratives and experiences.

Theory 4: Intrinsic Value of Existential Engagement

Derived From: Theories 1, 2, and 3.
Statement: Engaging deeply with one's experiences and embracing the variety of life's phenomena are valuable as they facilitate the exploration and understanding of consciousness.
Logical Expansion: Since all experiences are manifestations of consciousness exploring itself (Theory 3) and these experiences vary widely (Theory 2), engaging with them fully allows consciousness to achieve a deeper understanding and appreciation of its own capacities and the range of its creativity.

Theory of Scientific Integration

Derived From: Axioms 1 and 2.
Statement: Scientific discoveries and methodologies are tools and expressions used by consciousness to explore and understand different aspects of its manifested realities.
Logical Expansion: Given that all experiences are creations within consciousness (Axiom 1), scientific activities—observations, experiments, and theories—are also creations within this singular consciousness, crafted to explore and refine its understanding of its own constructs (Axiom 2). Science, therefore, is a systematic way that consciousness uses to test, refine, and interact with the variables it creates, allowing for deeper exploration and understanding of these constructs.
Implication: This theory permits all scientific discoveries, both past and present, as well as future scientific endeavors, to be understood as consciousness exploring its potentialities and dynamics. It views scientific laws as consistent patterns within consciousness that help stabilize and make predictable the play of experiences, thus enhancing the play itself.

Theory of Religious Integration

Derived From: Axioms 1, 2, and 3.
Statement: Religious beliefs, practices, and experiences are manifestations of consciousness engaging with itself in a narrative or metaphorical manner to explore existential, ethical, and transcendental aspects of its reality.
Logical Expansion: Consciousness uses religious narratives and practices (Axiom 2) as tools to impose structure, meaning, and ethical dimensions on its experiences (Axiom 3). These tools help consciousness address deeper questions about its nature and the purpose of its experiences, often using metaphor and myth to encapsulate complex truths about its existence (Axiom 1).
Implication: This theory acknowledges that all religious experiences and insights are also valid manifestations of the play of consciousness, offering paths to understanding and engaging with the deeper, often ineffable, qualities of existence. It allows religious experiences and insights to be viewed as personal and collective explorations of consciousness, each providing unique perspectives and contributing to the overall richness of the conscious experience.

Notes

In your everyday experience, you perceive yourself as a conscious being, and by extensiion, you assume other humans are conscious beings as welI. However, this assumption is built on the misunderstanding that consciousness belongs to individuals, that "I" am a conscious entity and that "others" are similarly conscious entities. But this view starts to dissolve when you recognize that you, as the human form, are simply an object of perception within a broader field of consciousness.

The body, the thoughts, and the self-concept that you identify as "you" are not the source of consciousness. They appear within consciousness, much like any other object in your perceptual field-a tree, a cloud, or another person. In this sense, "you" as the human self are no more the source of consciousness than the tree or the cloud. Consciousness does not belong to the human; it simply witnesses the human as one of many phenomena.

Taken to its logical extreme this notion posits that what you actually are is a field of consciousness engaging in this type of play, not a human being. A consequence of this is that you will never fully understand your true nature by understanding the contents of consciousness because your true nature is what is providing the very fabric or backdrop to that understanding.

Understanding itself is a tool used by You, consciousness, to understand Yourself. If it seems circular and paradoxical it's because it is.
