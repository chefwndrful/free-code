Good morning!

The device plugged into the wall outlet next to the bed has been making a very strange/annoying noise the past couple days. It sounds like there's some sort of a fan running inside of it. It's also begun to heat up. It seems to be screwed into the outlet, and is unable to be removed manually.

As this has been impacting my sleep, please let me know when someone will be around to service it or provide instructions on removing it from the outlet. I look forward to a speedy resolution on this.

Thank you 😁
