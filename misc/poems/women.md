I was just thinking in comparing the masculine and the feminine genders energy sexes whatever you want to call it but the duality of masculine feminine I think it's it's such a fundamental duality and it's so interesting

Things I was thinking about was that every man comes from a woman but no woman has ever come from a man and so in a certain sense you could say the woman is the more rooted or primordial being

And yet, despite everything the woman has all her fertility, her reproductive system, her ability to grow the baby. She's still missing that one final piece that one last key that can unlock the process of life to start happening in her anew

And so the masculine energy I think is so unique because the feminine is sort of 99.9% complete. The feminine has everything that it needs except that one last piece which the masculine has and I think that dynamic is so powerful
