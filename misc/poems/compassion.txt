If I die collapse inside in the black hole spiral

The bottom of the bottom the bottomless pit of demise.
It was nothingness the whole time.
A Zen fire.
The koan collapses in my mind and a strange loop feeds
and the oroborus feeds
and my need to be me increases
trees stretch their leaves to the sky
evaporate the dew drops
pull the wool from my eyes.
A flick of my elder wand flies
a killing curse which cuts the child's mind.
A scar so vast and wide
I'll define
I'll awaken an enlightened science

The disciples deny
as Jesus Christ cries to the father
Why have you abandoned your child tonight?
My stairway to heaven collides
if the society's anxiety spires don't subside
my blood would pour from wine.
Roll away the stone and find that Christ is alive

As Buddha drops inside
sits in silence

As lao tsu walks the River of Life
floats by and by
as the pathless path is generated before his eyes

As kabir sings and rings and laughs and plays high in the garden of Eden awaken child

The stairway to heaven is paved with lies and the devil tries with his hell fire to subside the light

The clouds in the storm sky
can only abide for a while.
The blue sky lies behind
and the stars in the night sky
tell the stories of past lives

Look inside and find
that you were Divine the whole time
