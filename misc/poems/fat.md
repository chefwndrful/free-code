Another thing to note is the baseline body composition of an individual will also determine how and if they store fat

Correct me if I'm wrong but having more muscle tends to lead to the more efficient burning of fat and maybe could make it less likely for fat to be stored

I'm also wondering if having extra muscle might provide a place for the extra blood sugar to go. Could the body put the extra blood sugar in the muscles in the same way that it puts it in fat? The main point being that perhaps the baseline composition of the body also determines how the body will respond to the diet.

This could lead to a sort of runaway snowball effect whereby you start to gain a little bit of extra weight or your body composition starts to change and it becomes more and more reinforced in whatever it's doing to handle the strain of the diet and perhaps this leads to a runaway effect. I'm not sure

It's certainly ties back in with the idea of weight being the primary metric though, where someone can think that they're actually healthy and think that their diet is appropriate because they're at a reasonable weight when in reality they're actually putting tremendous strain on their body.
