It's a little bit funny
People just chasing after this money
A piece of paper in your pocket. It's all you wanted
It's the ecstasy of the modern working man's dream
Paper green
Everywhere to be seen
But the real green the mean tree
The grass that grows in the field
Don't you see that it's dying
And crying out for more friends
There's enough money to go on untill the end

I'm the man without money
Just look at me honey
Do you see somebody who's not running
The rat race
the fast pace of life in the 21st century
All this greed and greed
An economy of ecstasy
Addiction it seems to be

But I ride I awake and find that the universal timeline
These freestyles
I can pull them from the sky
From a dimension of silence inside
The tao rides and waves. I ride the waves of life
The rivers flow and fly and lead to the oceans tides
Combine find
The dew drops are evaporated just right
The wool is pulled from my eyes
The clouds in the sky precipitate and die
But they evaporate just right
From the ocean's tides
Carry the water into the forest
I want to know it. I want to just show it

I can't ride. I can't vibe. I can't seem to define
The consciousness that sits behind my mind
It's color and light. Just an insight
Just a seeming lie
A fifth dimension that lies and cries
The oroborus feeds and weaves and whines
But I cling to science
Cling to whatever can describe it
If the tao is silent then I might just drop inside
For a while
I can't define by and by
But I'll experience it in the present time

Drop these ego and pride times
As Buddha sits and dies
As the Stars collide and reflect just right
On the empty lakes tides of his mind
His eyes
Can see the Milky Way the lessons from past lives
An Aquarius who's alive
I embrace all that life provides
Detach from the world I fly
And ride the waves of the pulsars quakes and cries

Even Einstein's equations fail to describe
The dimension of silence inside
So I can trust that my inspired DNA peptides
Collide and swirl and spine just right

I'll recognize, I'll awaken the Christ inside
Where my disciples deny
And the society's anxiety spires
But like the Phoenix I can arise
And these hellfires provide strength to the steel
It wields a power of divine time

Drop inside child
And experience for yourself the Divine rhyme
Hear my words as they fly
The man inside has died
A deep silence arises
And the universal timeline can collide
Kind of like when a star combines
Smelts iron and dies
As gravity wins and cries
And even Einstein can't describe what lies inside

That's my message
My intercession
My lesson
Humanity come alive
Drop science
But only in so much as you recognize
The Divine side inside us

Balance on the wings of science and spiritual tides
Buddha tries
And Jesus Christ cries
As Lao Tsu floats with the River of Time
As Kabir rings and sings and brings the Sunshine
Into the garden come back to me child
The psychedelic apple chills to the spine
The moonlight
A blood sacrifice
The Wolf howls and cries
The witch cackles and dies
The fountain of youth provides

And in my eyes
This unicorn blood would produce eternal life
The dark mark in the sky
My killing curse flies
And my death eaters deny
Demise
But the child's mother's protection provides
A magic so powerful that I couldn't survive
But my horcrux would cling to the child
Speak to snakes and awake and find
The chamber lied inside
The basilisks venom would overcome my eyes
And the Phoenix would have to help me arise
From the sewer beneath life

The hell tides and lies
But I play dice with the devil and I
Send him to the wayside
My rhymes provide a lift
The butterfly's wings to go high
Ride the spring winds to the pines
Sing, riffs and rhymes

I'm the man without money
Just look at me honey
Do you see somebody who's not running
The rat race. The fast pace
Of life in the 21st century
All this greed and greed
An economy of ecstasy
An economy of a little time

A little derived cries lies
But the butterfly's wings provide lift to fly
And the caterpillar dies to the wayside
The Chrysalis collapses for the last time
Smelt iron

Even Einstein denies
As he tries to explain why
Space collides and collapses and dies
I'll tell you why child
So I can rhyme
So I can arise
I'm the one inside
I'm the god man
Who speaks through the empty tides
The man's mind steps aside
So the universal skyline
Like the radio receiver can fly
He channels the rhymes an intelligence Divine
He ascends like the enlightened side
Enlightened sigh
Recognize that we meet on the inside

I'll deny every devil his chance, his hell fire
I'll play dice
I roll for the suffice to say
Survived lies cries
But the lucky ones can survive
In the times
In the skies
Present moment provides
Colors and lights
Like a dream of the night time

The axiomatic lines
That arise from the scientists minds
How could these theorems describe
That which comes in color and light
That which comes from the inside

Science cry die
Recognize it's a waste of time
Just come back to the garden of Eden
And play for a while

The psychedelic apple queer
... And a beard
Adhere to my queer licks and lines
I'll define an enlightened science

(Musical interlude with queer sounding guitar riff that's played well)

Is that it?
Is that did I quit
Would I quit if these sick licks
Would line rhymes with Divine sides
And insights nirvonic ties
Even Kurt Cobain dies
But the inside consciousness, worns and whines

I play the guitar just right
I picked the strings in a deep scythe cuts your mind
And eyes
My rhymes
Step aside
The hellfire
The devil ties and cries
But I play him a song
And he subsides
A little bitch of my mind
And so I just fly on the wings of a butterfly

High in silence
Derived as my mind alive
And I can't seem to escape
These waking Fates that lie
I rhyme the same 10 words every time
But it's a freestyle
So I can get away with it by and by

I don't write the lyrics and lines
Before I start trying
To play
All day
I simply receive and come alive

Like the butterfly tries
Into the cocoon dies
The Chrysalis protection provides
Liquefy
The caterpillar has inside
Everything necessary
For the butterfly to arise
If you just trust life
You'll have to die

A shift of paradigm
Thomas Kuhn defines
A place where science denies
If consciousness persists
In a mystic mist
Then I'd get the gist
That life is a unified fire
That flies high silence
Abides inside my lyrics and lines
Collide
I'm enlightened
Try to deny using theorems and proofs
That arise from your mind
I escape into the universal skyline
Like the black hole, the place where Einstein
His observing eyes
But I derived that inside lied this event horizon
Which stretches for infinite time
Just colors and lights. Don't try to define
Using your mind
It's a dimension outside
Of space and time
