// use this as a template for introducing yourself at a new job

Hey team! I think this is the most excited I've ever been for a first day of work 😁

Consider me your new tech support wizard 🧙‍♂️
I'm kinda like Dumbledore, but If he liked cheap Latin American beer 🐔 and had a confusing experience with a Thai ladyboy earlier in the year

Anyway, one of the things I like to do when I start with a new team is take 5 minutes to get to know everyone 1-on-1, I need to build a rapport with each of you. Otherwise, it's too weird working all across the globe 🌍 (I ❤️ emojis deal with it)

As such, please select at least two topics from the following list to discuss in our meeting which you can schedule in my calendly below 👇🫡

- Which Led Zeppelin album is the best, and why is it Led Zeppelin IV
- Favorite Dr. Seuss book 🍄
- Which human value(s) is the most important for you
- Your favorite moment from 2024
- Your least favorite moment from 2024
- Your sexiest moment from 2024 😏
- Time travel or speak to animals?
- One thing I don't know about your country
- Most original world flag 🇳🇨🇵🇲
- Favorite currency
- Backpack Central America or Southeast Asia?
- How can I make your job and life more enjoyable everyday with my coding swaggah 😇

All right, let's wrap this up, I've had amazing experiences with so many of you and for those that I haven't, you're in for it 🤑🤠

Looking forward to meeting/seeing everyone!

Also, it's meme Monday, strap in 😹— my meme game is in another dimension 🚀
