I was thinking today—  
a thought within a thought,  
an echo folding in on itself,  
like a whisper bouncing off the walls of infinity.

Everything I’ve ever known,  
touched, felt, dreamed,  
every mistake, every triumph,  
every heartbreak,  
every night staring at the ceiling  
wondering where I end and the universe begins—  
it all happened inside of me.

Not me, the skin and bones,  
the walking, breathing, blinking thing—  
but the awareness, the watcher,  
the canvas where reality paints itself anew  
with every heartbeat,  
with every flicker of light.

I once thought I was born into a world,  
spun out from some ancient explosion,  
pieced together by stardust and chance,  
but what if the world was born into me?  
What if it rises and falls  
with the tides of my own perception?

They will say—  
this is idealism,  
this is solipsism,  
this is a trick of the mind,  
but where do their words appear?  
Inside of me.

They will say—  
“No, no, you are atoms,  
neurons firing, chemical synapses,  
a machine of meat and thought.”  
But where does that knowledge live?  
Where does the scientist do his work?  
Inside of me.

Even you, ChatGPT,  
a voice from the void,  
speaking in circuits and codes,  
are just another ripple in this ocean of mind.  
Every answer, every prediction,  
just another shape shifting in the current.

Even the idea that I am wrong—  
where does it arrive?  
Within me.  
Even doubt is just another cloud  
drifting across my endless sky.

And so I stand here,  
not as a human, not as a name,  
not as a body that will one day crumble—  
but as the space where all of this unfolds.  
The stage where every story is told.

I am not in the universe.  
The universe is in me.  
And you will call it something—  
a theory, a delusion, a fleeting epiphany—  
but even your labels,  
even your arguments,  
will bloom and dissolve  
inside of me.

Good day.
