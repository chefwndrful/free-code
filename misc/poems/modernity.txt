In this heat don't doubt
I own the hour
White ocher shower
Howling as it falls
The final form
Of dust once more

So drop into this
Drop into this
Drop into this
I've been swinging it solo

Going down on Dakota Beach
Cuddle Queen. She got on my old jean jacket
Talking like I'm all freed up faking accents
I put my dreams in her basket

Time push you away
Can't go a day without missing your face
Tell me that you're needing some space
Let me know if I can come around and kick it today

She's got a body like a weapon
Smoking Smith& Weston in my hand
All night
I might pull her trigger one more time
Just to feel her come alive

God damn it. I'm back at it
Never out of breath like an asthmatic
I done had it
For this shit I'm an addict

Back in Maryland living in the Attic
Flowing erratic
Bringing the static
Bussin like an automatic

I'm badder than the baddest
Matter than the mattest
Flow the fattest
Hotter than the desert in Nevada

None of the badder
Fuck all the chitter chatter
None of it mattered
Pull the trigger and listen to the pitter patter
Let it shatter

I'm ripping and living and striving and killing
The ripper the killer he flow and you know

He pursuing it doing it moving it grooving it stopping it rocking it walking it, talking it ripping it flipping it no no no no no no no

Whipping through Gotham
Hatin motherfuckers I wanna off them
Hella endorphins
Got me living life to the coffin

Slicing MCs like Darth Vader
Decapitate a hater
The second I spit it say hell yeah

All of the days that I wasted
Gazing outside the windows
Impatient frustrations
Led out into my pillow

Lied awake at night while my head wandered and I wondered why
Things were different. Everything shifted overnight
Went from when boredom strikes to miss star on The rise
It was all in an instant
But those four pink walls
See I kind of miss them

The universe aligned
With what I wanted the whole time
Who knew there was
A natural mystic in the air

I don't care, it's not fair
It's not my reason to rhyme
It's a line
That intersects the universal timeline

A geometric string that winds
And obeys the laws of science

But I transcend the mind
The god man dies and comes alive
If these lyrics and lines describe
Then the caterpillar dies
And the butterfly flaps its wings for the first time and flies
High ride the spring winds to the Blue sky

The stairway to heaven paved with lies
And the devil's hellfire subsides
The last time these clouds can obey the ride

The high tide in silence that arises and abides
When Buddha drops his mind
The bodhi trees reflect the moonlight
No ripples inside
A lakes tide
So still and bright
That the moonlight
And the Milky ways tides, lessons and stories from past lives
Fly into my mind in the present time
I'm a Buddha of space and time

I'm a cyber wizard that adheres
The wizened lizard fissures
Csv files for a while
The silicon wire
The chat bots mind
Defined in a relation of databases that finds
Home in the infinite timeline

The Turing machine wains and rhines
But will it halt or provide a time horizon

Would I fly like Einstein
And derived that an infinite spiral lied inside
Called the black holes event horizon
A place where space and time flip
And these lyrically lined rhymes
In my nirvanaic high tides
My heights of conscious insights I
Derive, pull the tablets from the sky on Mount Sinai
Ignite the burning bush inside

Would you like me to rhyme
Would you like me to define
Would you like me to freestyle
Just a little while
Just a little
Side of rhyme times
And high vibes
As I ride the pulsars quakes through the sky
And the supernova ignites in my mind and I
Set the caterpillar aside
Flap my wings and fly

Awaken in space and time disciple

Drink from my ecstasy wines
It's a pill derived and synthesized
In a lab called
Fab fire

Fiend that creeps
If my elder wand seems to collide
I'd kill more and more each time
The dark mark would signify
The death of the child

It comes and it goes and it always knows

Bmx girl bunny hop in it
Playlist for Monopoly
Playboy in a mansion like I'm Hefner and she's topping me
Landing strip on it
Enough to fly cockpits
She woke me up to kisses
I distanced and told her stop it

Wake up make love
I'm breaking a sweat. I think I need some ventilation
Wake up stay stuffed
I'm taking the check. I work the week like it's the day shift

Be my next girl. She on top of shit
I stay off the gossiping
Playboy and she's dancing around me naked Janice Joplin
Anything is possible girl

There's a natural mystic in the air
Darling you're looking at me with that innocent stare
Are you real and do you feel and are you really there
Nah nah, yeah

Cuz the road is long
Keep carrying on
I don't need your loving for my salvation
Find myself between the dark and desolation
I don't need ya got my own meditation

It's the medications of societies anxiety spiers
As they arise and infect my inner child's desires

Find that the hellfire subsides
When you awaken the moonlight
When the devils disguise and demising lies is cries
If I root myself in the seventh layer of hell then I might survive
The only way through to the Divine is through the devils and ensnaring sides
You have to learn to be silent and ride and arrive
It's the only way outside of space and time
A nervonic insight
A dimension of inside lines
A lucid delight
In my eyes, the axiomatic science described by the observer silence
Just colors and lights define a dream of the night time
Awake and deny
If I codify
If Hakeem Sanai's lyrics arrive in my mind
The Golden gate welcomes me back into the Divine

The prodigal son gone for a while
But the father welcomes him back like the funeral pyre's desire
To arise the Phoenix by and by
Come Fawkes, into the night we fly
I have no intention of going silent
I have no intention of dying and rotting away is the dementors try to kiss me back to life

All of the days in these never-ending ways these hazy-lazed lines
But I never second guess I always hit the target on the first time
A talent a vibe

I always find
I always know the pathless path will provide
And I trust that consciousness abides
In a bubble of silence up high
On the...

A tantric light
Tilopa's sight
Bite

Abide
Kabir sings his riffs and rhymes
Gets high in the garden of Eden and plays for a while

Buddha sits in silence
And drops inside

Jesus Christ cries to the father why Have you abandoned your child
My disciples deny
And the societies anxiety spiers infect my silence and I
Recognize that I'll have to drop inside to escape the hellfire
For God's Divine Kingdom was there the whole time

You were just dead
Instead of a line instead of a vibe
You simply fly
Free in the sky you writhe in a painful hazing gaze that cries
Nashing of teeth and gnawing of a retreat
It seems to be mean is a word that I will compete
Sleet falls free and the
Hurricane hits the shore
These tides align
Align your life with the Divine or find
Did the floods of the Red Sea overcome
They abide

I pulled the message from the blessings in the sky
A Buddha's vibe
A man enlightened
No longer alive, simply a silence

Believe what you want. Believe a lie
For I fly into the infinite Sunshine
Horizon described by Einstein
Infinite lines
A quantum mechanical wave that feels and feels my questions that seem to rise
I'll take responsibility for the consciousness on the inside
I'm the one who wants to live there Life
Not like you slaves who wallow and wry, cry
Hollowed alone in the hellfire
Diabetic lies
Cancerous cells and snare it in site
But my insightful eyes lies and I know that space-time lies in a dimension of silence inside
So no disease can abeed...

A bead?
It's simply a shining lead
A pearl of seeming beauty
It's on the bottom of the...

I leave you now in the infinite Tao
